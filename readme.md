This exercise is based on [a _Strategist_ post](https://nymag.com/strategist/2021/09/new-york-magazine-cover-store-2021.html) linking to sales of famous _New York_ covers.

To kick things off, run `npm start`. You'll find your [frontend](client/index.html) at `http://localhost:1234` and your [backend](server/app.js) at `http://localhost:8080`.
