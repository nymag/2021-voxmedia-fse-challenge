            Today, we’re launching the <em>New York</em> Magazine cover store,
            where you can buy some of the iconic covers that the magazine has
            created over its 53-year history. We’re starting with about 50
            covers from our archives, from our very first issue from April 1968
            to this year’s Fall Preview showcasing the cast of
            <em>Succession</em>.
          </p>

            There are some other recent favorites, like the New Yawk merch
            monster from our Spring Fashion issue and our “Reasons to Love New
            York” cover where we paid tribute to all the places that closed
            since the pandemic began. You’ll find some classic Milton Glaser
            illustrations, including “A Gentile’s Guide to Jewish Food” from
            July 1968 and “Why Everybody’s Talking About Gossip” from May 1976.

            We’ve also included some covers and designs you’ve never been able
            to purchase before, like the one where Bert Stern recreated Marilyn
            Monroe’s last (nude) photo shoot with Lindsay Lohan.
